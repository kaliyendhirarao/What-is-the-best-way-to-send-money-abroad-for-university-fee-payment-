It can be quite a feat getting an admission into an international university. The whole process must be quite exhilarating with all the efforts you would have put in. After all the hard work, the last thing you would want to stress about is paying your tuition fee. We list the different options that you have to transfer the international tuition fee abroad from India. 

University Payment Portal

Most international universities have their payment portals that accept foreign payments. This method offers a lot of conveniences as you can transfer the money directly into the university’s account. However, it is not the right option if you want to save money. The transaction can be a bit costly. 

Bank Transfer

Using your bank account to pay for university fees abroad can be very expensive. Banks offer poor exchange rates and charge a high service fee. This leads to an increase in the overall cost of the transfer. Since banks do not have forex as a primary service, they do not bother to offer competitive rates. 

International Bank Draft 

These drafts allow you to send a large sum of money to a foreign country. It is quite similar to a cashier’s check. Before proceeding ahead, you must confirm with the university if they accept this method of payment. 

International Money Transfer Service Provider

Sending money through an international money transfer service provider is a recommended option. They offer a lot of conveniences and great value of every rupee you spend on the transaction. The exchange rate will be the most competitive and better than banks. There will be a small transfer fee, but it will be worth it to pay a fee to foreign university from India. You can also expect to receive great customer service to ensure that transaction happens successfully.  

Cash

This is not a preferable option and ideally should be your last resort to pay university fee abroad. You can exchange the currency when in India or a foreign country. If you choose the first option, beware of the cash amount you can carry with yourself during the travel by plane. Carrying a larger sum would usually not be permitted. 

Bottom Line

The entire process of securing the admission and migrating to the country for studies can be chaotic. The last thing you would want is to worry about the tuition fee payment.
